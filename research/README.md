# Research

I don't know what the most performant ways are to do different queries are.
So here's a collection of approaches!

## Running an sbot

If you're already running Patchbay, it should have all the plugins you need up and running

If not, open a new terminal and run `npm run test-server`

## Running each test

With an sbot running, run e.g `node research/1_nested_callbacks.js`
